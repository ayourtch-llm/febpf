# febpf kernel conformance mode & differential fuzzer specification

This document specifies `febpf conftest` and `febpf fuzz`: two tools that
validate febpf's interpreter and JIT against each other and, when privileges
allow, against the **real Linux kernel** via the `bpf(2)` syscall.
For XDP, `conftest --packet` independently compares both verifier verdicts,
then the XDP return verdict and exact output packet bytes.

> Status: see the STATUS section at the bottom of this file.

The design constraint is the project's: **zero dependencies**. All kernel
interaction is done through raw `syscall(2)` via inline `asm!` (syscall number
`321` = `SYS_bpf` on x86-64), exactly like the JIT's `sys` module allocates
executable memory. No libc, no `libbpf`.

---

## 1. The `bpf(2)` ABI, byte-exact

```
long syscall(321 /*SYS_bpf*/, int cmd, union bpf_attr *attr, unsigned int size);
```

Return value: a non-negative fd (or 0 for verb-style commands), or `-errno`
(the raw kernel convention; the wrapper maps the `-4095..0` band to `Err`).

`union bpf_attr` is a union of per-command anonymous structs. We never model
the whole union. Instead we use a **zeroed fixed-size byte buffer** (128 bytes
— larger than the highest field offset any command below touches, and smaller
than the kernel's `sizeof(union bpf_attr)`), write the fields we need at their
exact C offsets, and pass `size = 128`. The kernel copies our 128 bytes,
zero-fills the remainder of its own `attr`, and `CHECK_ATTR` validates that the
tail is zero (it is — we zeroed it). This idiom is version-robust: new trailing
fields in the union do not affect us.

Commands used (`enum bpf_cmd` ordinals, stable UAPI):

| cmd | value | purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `BPF_MAP_CREATE`    | 0  | create a kernel map matching a `MapDef` |
| `BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM` | 2 | seed initial map contents (`.data`/`.rodata`) |
| `BPF_PROG_LOAD`     | 5  | load + verify a program |
| `BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN` | 10 | run the loaded program on supplied input |

Program types used:

- `BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER` (value `1`) for ordinary conformance runs.
- `BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP` (value `6`) for packet-context programs. XDP TEST_RUN
  returns `r0` as `retval` and copies the possibly-mutated packet to
  `data_out`; `data_size_out` is read back and bounds-checked.

### 1.1 `BPF_PROG_LOAD` field offsets (bytes, from start of the union)

```
 0  __u32 prog_type
 4  __u32 insn_cnt
 8  __u64 insns          (pointer to Vec<[u8;8]> encoded program)
16  __u64 license        (pointer to "GPL\0")
24  __u32 log_level      (0 = no verifier log; 1+ = capture)
28  __u32 log_size
32  __u64 log_buf        (pointer to a user buffer for the verifier log)
40  __u32 kern_version   (unused for SOCKET_FILTER; 0)
44  __u32 prog_flags
48  char  prog_name[16]
64  __u32 prog_ifindex
...
```

We set: prog_type, insn_cnt, insns, license, and (optionally) log_level/
log_size/log_buf to capture the kernel verifier's rejection reason.

### 1.2 `BPF_MAP_CREATE` field offsets

```
 0  __u32 map_type       (BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY=2, BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH=1)
 4  __u32 key_size
 8  __u32 value_size
12  __u32 max_entries
16  __u32 map_flags
...
28  char  map_name[16]
```

### 1.3 `BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM` field offsets

```
 0  __u32 map_fd
 (pad to 8)
 8  __u64 key            (pointer to key bytes)
16  __u64 value          (pointer to value bytes)
24  __u64 flags          (BPF_ANY=0)
```

### 1.4 `BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN` field offsets (the `test` sub-struct)

```
 0  __u32 prog_fd
 4  __u32 retval         (OUTPUT: the program's r0 as u32)
 8  __u32 data_size_in
12  __u32 data_size_out
16  __u64 data_in        (pointer to input packet bytes)
24  __u64 data_out       (pointer to output buffer, or NULL)
32  __u32 repeat
36  __u32 duration       (OUTPUT)
40  __u32 ctx_size_in
44  __u32 ctx_size_out
48  __u64 ctx_in
56  __u64 ctx_out
64  __u32 flags
68  __u32 cpu
72  __u32 batch_size
```

For `SOCKET_FILTER`, `TEST_RUN` builds an `skb` from `data_in`; the kernel
requires `data_size_in >= ETH_HLEN` (14). We always pass at least 16 bytes of
input (zero-padded when the caller gives less).

XDP receives the exact packet without padding. Both the attr and output packet
buffers retain mutable Rust pointer provenance across the syscall because the
kernel writes through both.

### 1.5 XDP differential sequence

`febpf conftest --packet frame.bin program.bpf.o` treats the kernel strictly as
an oracle; it does not replace febpf verification or execution:

1. Verify with febpf's `Config::xdp`, preserving its rejection trace.
2. When accepted, execute with `Vm::run_xdp` and retain the mutated packet.
3. Independently load as `BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP` and compare verifier verdicts.
4. When both accept, TEST_RUN the original packet and compare `retval` plus
   every output byte.

A mismatch prints the first differing byte and both lengths. Exit code `1`
identifies either verifier or output disagreement; `2` remains unavailable
kernel access; `3` means rejection/test-run failure without a verdict mismatch.

---

## 2. Map handling (kernel side of `Vm::new`)

The interpreter's `Vm::new` patches map-reference `lddw` instructions from the
`(src=BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_{FD,VALUE}, imm=map_index)` pseudo-form into concrete
region addresses. The kernel does the analogous thing but expects **real map
file descriptors** in the `lddw` imm with `src_reg = BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_FD (1)`.

So the kernel path:

1. For each `MapDef`, `BPF_MAP_CREATE` a matching kernel map (array→type 2,
   hash→type 1; key/value/max_entries copied across). Seed `.data`/`.rodata`
   contents with `BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM`. (`.rodata` freeze via `BPF_MAP_FREEZE`
   is intentionally skipped — freezing forbids the map-value writes our test
   programs never do, and unfrozen is strictly more permissive for load.)
2. Encode the program, then rewrite every map-reference `lddw`: set
   `src_reg = 1` (BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_FD) and `imm = kernel_fd`.
   `BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_VALUE` (direct global-data value pointer, a two-slot form
   carrying an offset in the second slot's imm) is rewritten the same way, with
   `src_reg = 3` and the offset in the second slot preserved.
3. `BPF_PROG_LOAD`; on success `BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN`.

The fuzzer generates **map-free** programs, so this path is exercised by
`conftest` on real objects, not by `fuzz`.

---

## 3. Capability probe & graceful degradation

`BPF_PROG_LOAD` requires root or `CAP_BPF` (and, when
`kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled` is `1`/`2`, root/`CAP_BPF` unconditionally).
Rather than parse capabilities, we **probe**: attempt to load a trivial 2-insn
program (`mov r0,0; exit`). If it succeeds we have privilege (the fd is closed
immediately); if it fails with `EPERM`/`EACCES` we don't.

- `conftest`: if the probe fails, print
  `kernel side unavailable (permission denied); run as root` and exit with a
  **distinct** code (2, vs 1 for an actual interp/JIT/kernel mismatch), after
  still running and reporting the interp-vs-JIT comparison.
- `fuzz`: kernel mode is opt-in via `--kernel`. Without it, fuzzing is
  interp-vs-JIT only and needs no privilege. With `--kernel` but no privilege,
  it prints the skip line and continues interp-vs-JIT.
- Tests: kernel-dependent behavior is never asserted; tests probe and print
  `skipped: no bpf privilege` instead of failing, so CI stays green
  unprivileged.

---

## 4. Differential fuzzer: program generation

Goal: generate random programs that **both** verifiers (febpf's and the
kernel's) accept, so any `r0` disagreement is a real engine bug. Strategy is
deliberately conservative:

- **Seeded PRNG** (SplitMix64). The seed is printed on every failure and
  accepted via `--seed` to reproduce bit-for-bit. Determinism is a hard
  requirement (matches the project's fixed-seed prandom philosophy).
- **Init every register** `r0..=r9` first with a `mov64 imm` of a random
  constant. The kernel verifier rejects reads of uninitialized registers; this
  sidesteps that entirely. `r1` (ctx) and `r10` (fp) are left untouched — no
  pointer arithmetic, no memory access, so the virtual-address safety model and
  the kernel's pointer tracking are both trivially satisfied.
- **Body**: a random sequence of ALU (reg/imm, 32/64-bit) and conditional
  branches. Ops: add sub mul or and xor mov neg, plus lsh/rsh/arsh with
  **imm** shift amounts in range. Branches are `if rX cc rY goto +N` /
  `if rX cc imm goto +N`, **forward-only** and bounded so the CFG is a DAG —
  no loops, guaranteed termination, and the kernel verifier's path budget is
  never a concern.
- **End**: `exit` (returns `r0`).

### 4.1 Divergence traps deliberately avoided or normalized

- **div / mod**: excluded from the generator. eBPF `÷0 ⇒ 0` and `%0 ⇒
  unchanged` are implemented by febpf, but guarding every generated divisor to
  match the kernel exactly (and the signed-overflow `INT_MIN / -1` corner) adds
  noise without adding coverage. Left as documented future work; if added, the
  generator must guard divisors `!= 0` with a branch, or the harness must
  special-case.
- **shifts**: shift amounts are masked identically by all three engines —
  Rust's `wrapping_shl/shr` masks by the type width (63/31), x86 `shl/shr` mask
  in hardware (63/31), and the kernel does `& 63`/`& 31`. So shifts agree; the
  generator still restricts imm shift counts to `0..width` for clarity.
- **byte swap (`END`) / movsx / variable-count shift**: allowed (JIT defers
  them to the interpreter, so interp-vs-JIT is trivially consistent) but kept
  out of the initial generator to minimize kernel-verifier surprises.
- **32-bit sub-register semantics**: a 32-bit ALU op zero-extends into the full
  64-bit register on all three engines; the generator freely mixes widths.

### 4.2 Result normalization

`TEST_RUN` returns `retval` as `u32`. febpf's `r0` is `u64`. The comparison is
on the **low 32 bits** for the kernel diff (the kernel truncates), and on the
full `u64` for interp-vs-JIT (both are exact). A mismatch dumps the failing
program via `disasm::disasm_program` so it is immediately replayable with
`febpf run`/`febpf conftest`.

---

## 5. Module layout

- `src/kbpf.rs` — raw `bpf(2)` wrapper (`sys_bpf`), capability probe, map
  handling, typed socket-filter/XDP load paths, and TEST_RUN output capture.
  `KernelProgram` keeps rewritten map fds alive through execution. Guarded to
  x86-64 Linux; a stub elsewhere.
- `src/fuzz.rs` — SplitMix64 PRNG and the conservative program generator, plus
  the fuzz driver (`interp` vs `jit` vs optional `kernel`).
- `main.rs` — `conftest` and `fuzz` subcommands + CLI flags.

---

## 6. Staged plan

- (a) raw `bpf(2)` wrapper + capability probe
- (b) `conftest` single-program path (interp/jit/kernel diff, maps)
- (c) fuzzer interp-vs-JIT
- (d) fuzzer `--kernel` + CLI polish

---

## STATUS

**Done.** All four stages (a–d) are implemented, tested and green.

- `src/kbpf.rs` — raw `bpf(2)` wrapper, capability probe, `map_create` /
  `map_update` / `prog_load` / `test_run`, and `run_program`. The byte offsets
  encoded here were **verified field-by-field against the running kernel's
  `<linux/bpf.h>` via `offsetof`** (PROG_LOAD, MAP_CREATE, MAP_UPDATE_ELEM,
  TEST_RUN all match; `sizeof(union bpf_attr) = 168`, so the 128-byte buffer is
  safely smaller).
- `src/fuzz.rs` — SplitMix64 PRNG + conservative generator + `interp_vs_jit`.
- `src/conftest.rs` (bin) — `conftest`/`fuzz` commands with the exit-code
  contract above.
- `tests/conftest.rs` — probe/skip kernel tests + always-on interp-vs-JIT
  differential.

**XDP extension (2026-07-12):** `conftest --packet` performs independent
febpf/kernel XDP verification and, on mutual acceptance, compares verdict plus
output packet. An always-on regression proves febpf verifier-backed mutation;
the privilege-gated regression requires exact kernel TEST_RUN agreement.
Validated as root on this host: the bounded packet writer was accepted by both
verifiers, returned `XDP_PASS` from both engines, and produced byte-identical
mutated output through both the regression test and the end-to-end CLI.

**Validated:** interp-vs-JIT agree over tens of thousands of generated
programs (fuzzer + unit test + integration test). The fuzzer already caught one
real bug — a generator off-by-one that emitted an out-of-bounds forward branch.

**Kernel side validated as root (2026-07-11):** the first real run exposed a
harness miscompile — the attr buffer went to the kernel via a *shared*
reference, so LLVM legally folded the TEST_RUN `retval` read-back to 0 in
release builds (every kernel run "returned 0"). Fixed by passing the attr as
`&mut` down to `sys_bpf(*mut u8)`; see the comment in `kbpf::call`. After the
fix, run as root on this host: `fuzz --kernel --iters 10000` all agree,
the previously-failing seed agrees, `cargo test --test conftest` all pass
(privilege-gated tests included), and `conftest` on a real object agrees.
Lesson: kernel write-backs through bpf(2) attrs need mutable provenance;
"structural validation" cannot catch a provenance miscompile — only a real
privileged run could.

**Remaining / next steps** (none blocking):

1. Extend the generator with **guarded div/mod** (branch divisor `!= 0` before
   dividing) to cover the div-by-zero / `INT_MIN / -1` divergence surface.
3. Add memory ops (stack loads/stores) to the generator, and map-using
   programs to the kernel differential (the `conftest` map path already exists;
   the generator just doesn't emit maps yet).
